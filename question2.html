    <h1>The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</h1>
    <p>
        Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. <br> the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver.<br>Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.
